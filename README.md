# PharmaOnline Project

**PharmaOnline** is a project whose main goal is to facilitate access to health related products, especially pharmaceuticals, in Haiti.
Often, it is difficult for people to find their prescribed drugs (*and sometimes even over-the-counter drugs*) around Haiti's cities due to various reasons.

- Scarcity of the drugs themselves

- An unorganized system

- Lack of documentation and real time knowledge of the generic drugs that are available or unavailable on the market.


Because of this, we found that a system that tells where and when (eventually) the product is available *could help make healthcare in general an easier area to navigate.*

This project was built with the [Heroku Django Starter template](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-django-template)

There are many companies that provides pharmaceutical services online to the people. There is a huge benefit of online pharmacies, people can buy and get medical treatments and products at home by ordering on the site of the company. UK Meds ( https://www.ukmeds.co.uk ) is also an online pharmaceutical company that provides medical services online on the internet.
